# Hangman




### Overview:
This repo is for the software implementation of the classic single-player game of Hangman. A description of the game plus the requirements of this implementations are included below.

### The game:
The program will generate a random 6-10 letter word for the user to figure out by choosing letters that might be included in the word. The user will have nine chances to choose a letter. If the user successfully figures out the word they will earn a point. Finding the word with seven or fewer letters chosen will earn them an additional point. If the game ends before the word is found, the user will lose a point. The user also has the option to "Give up" in middle of a round - that will minus two points their score. There will be a "Reset" button on the screen that will reset the score so the user can get a fresh start.
